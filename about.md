Hi my name is Joseph and I am a software developer living in Toronto.
Currently I am unemployed and love to hear about new experiences so feel free to email me.
I have professional experience building web applications with Ruby on Rails and am
currently working with React Native. I actually built a fun app with React Native
available at https://www.joyley.co.

I am for all the experienes and opportunities I was able to receive and aim to not let them go to waste.
