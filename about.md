Hi my name is Joseph and I am a software developer living in Toronto.
Currently I am unemployed and love to hear about new experiences so feel free to email me.
I have professional experience building web applications with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.


I am currently working frequently with React Native. I actually built a fun app with React Native
available at https://www.joyley.co.

When I'm not working on personal projects, I am learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/).
